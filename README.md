# pingpongAI
Created an AI using DQN reinforcement learning to play pingpong.

NOTE: Important to check requirements.txt. The py files may not run properly on python 3.9. 

ai_creation is the main py file to create the AIs 

ai_training trains the AI. 

ai_load loads the best AI I have created. Run ai_load to see the results! 

You can look at demo_video for a preview of the AI I have created.
